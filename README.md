This repository contains the files for challenge 11. Challenge 11 asks us to scrape data from a mars news website and analyse the data. 

You will find part 1 in the jupyter notebook mars_notebook_1.ipynb and part 2 in jupyter notebook mars_notebook_2.ipynb. 

An explaination of code is provided in the comments. 

Thanks for reading!
